     ABOUT _ US</h2>
     
     <p class="span"> 
     Everyone can agree on ice cream. From toddlers to grandparents,
      it’s the irresistible treat that brings people together and creates a community.
       And that’s precisely why I started Sweet Science; because ice cream should be great tasting and
        complex while uniting fellow ice cream lovers together for a few moments of chilled bliss.
     From chasing the ice cream truck on a hot summer day, to grabbing a scoop after your first soccer
       game of the season, to having your faces and 
     hands covered in melted chocolate goodness, there is nothing more reminiscent of childhood than indulging in ice cream.</p>
